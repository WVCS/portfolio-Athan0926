  <h1>About Me</h1>

<p><b>As a person who has expierence with jobs, I think I would know what I would be doing, if not I can definitely figure it out without asking. I am a student that is currently attending a highschool called,"Westview". I havo no experience with community services. To me, I think having no experience with community services isn't important because I'm still a hard worker and will do anything to get the job done. </b></p>
